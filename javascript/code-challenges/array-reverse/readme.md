# Reverse an Array
How to reverse an array without utilizing `Array.reverse()` method .


### Challenge
I have to write function that will reverse an array without using `Array.reverse()` method.

### Approach & Efficiency
- I created a function called `reverseArray` that take in an array as an argument, in the function I created a new empty array and I did a regular for loop to loop over the original array elements and I used `unshift` method to add each element to the beginning of the new array, finally returned the new array.
